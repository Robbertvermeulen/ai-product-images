## 🔴 The Problem We Solve

### The €40 Billion Problem

E-commerce businesses lose **40% of potential sales** due to incomplete product imagery. Studies show:

-   75% of shoppers rely on product photos when making purchase decisions
-   Products with 8+ images have 2x higher conversion rates
-   Lifestyle shots increase add-to-cart rates by 35%
-   Scale/size images reduce returns by 28%

### Current Pain Points

1. **Photography is expensive** - €500-2000 per product shoot
2. **Time-consuming** - 2-4 weeks from shoot to published images
3. **Inconsistent quality** - Different photographers, different styles
4. **Missing shot types** - Most listings lack lifestyle, scale, or detail shots
5. **Platform requirements** - Each marketplace needs different image formats

## 💡 Our Solution
